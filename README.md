# jupyter_notebooks

Jupyter notebooks of some projects for AP Computer Science Principles.

1) Image Processing: basic image processing using Numpy arrays: given a jpg, use Python to access pixels, crop, tint, convert to black/white.
2) Discrete Fourier Transform: explains the math behind the Discrete Fourier Transform and illustrates its utility through analyzing and manipulating audio files in Python. For example, given an audio recording of a piano, we can figure out mathematically the frequency content of the audio(what note or chord)! Really amazing and easy to follow with some basic trig.

4) Basic Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas. Analyze csv/excel/tabula datasets like IMDB top 1000 movies, alcoholic consumption of world countries.
5) Introduction to Neural Networks: 
   This is a gentle introduction to Neural Networks. The goal of this Video Lecture Series is to write a Python program from scratch that recognizes handwritten digits. The course attempts to make the material as accessible as possible. The programming prerequisites are minimal: 1) Basic Python or some programming experience in another language. 2) Numpy. Both of these are covered in the Jupyter Notebook tutorials below. The video lectures cover basic Python and Numpy necessary for writing the program.

The mathematical requirements are also minimal. A precalculus background is all that is required. The course, however, will cover some basic multivariable calculus, including the discussion of partial derivatives, the chain rule and the gradient, necessary to understand Gradient Descent and backpropagation.
